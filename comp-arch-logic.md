## Four Things Common to all computers
- input
  - via typing keys
  - via speaking
  - via drawing (drawpad)
  - via mouse click/scroll
  - video recording
  - consol 
- storage 
- processing
- output

1. Computer processor takes information from memory - series of commands
2. sends processed info back to be stored in memory
3. continues 1-3 until system is ready for output

When computers connect to the internet:
a computers output becomes another's input 

## Binary System:
- only digits are: 0 and 1

## Circuts and Logic
- simple circut takes an electrical signal and flips it ( 1 to 0, vice versa)
- to send output, signal MUST match input to output or else it sends it back (flips it from 1 > 0 or 0 > 1)
- complicated circuts take multiple signals and combine them to give different results
- logic gates - think of the ubuntu tree except each path has a requirement (and/or/not/nand) 
- All information processed is just lots of simple small operations put together 

# Harware vs Software
- software tells CPU what to do 
- hardware is computer machinery
