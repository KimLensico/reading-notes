## Growth Mindset 
What growth mindset means to me is: 
> a growth mindset is to continually learn and adjust to my mindset and to continually expand my knowledge. this doesn't mean growth is a "location" to get to but it's really just a path that never stops that's filled with all kinds of potentials and it all starts on where we are. 

## 3 Reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset
- I *don't* and *won't* ever know EVERYTHING ~~and im going to have a bad time~~ BECAUSE there can be continual growth (**a good thing**)
- *Perfection is the enemy of to trying to grow*
- **take a break when you hit a road block... it's going to break later anyway**
