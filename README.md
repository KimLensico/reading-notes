Reading notes for Code 102 

# About Me
## Education:
My name is Kim. I am a student for Code 102.
I am currently enrolled at CodeFellows. 

## Background
I was born and raised in the PNW near Seattle. 

I was in the banking industry for about four years before deciding that it wasn't my long term aspiration. I decided to go to the thing I love to work with most: computers. ~~I spent too much time on the internet... ask my mom~~

I love playing video games. My favorite to play is league. I stream it on twitch often and I do my best to not be a toxic player or a troll (for the most part). My main is Soraka. **The banana queen**.

## Growth Mindset 
What growth mindset means to me is: 
> a growth mindset is to continually learn and adjust to my mindset and to continually expand my knowledge. this doesn't mean growth is a "location" to get to but it's really just a path that never stops that's filled with all kinds of potentials and it all starts on where we are. 

## 3 Reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset
- I *don't* and *won't* ever know EVERYTHING ~~and im going to have a bad time~~ BECAUSE there can be continual growth (**a good thing**)
- *Perfection is the enemy of to trying to grow*
- **take a break when you hit a road block... it's going to break later anyway**
