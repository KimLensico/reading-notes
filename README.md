## Growth Mindset 
What growth mindset means to me is: to continually learn and adjust to what the most efficient way to continually expand my knowledge. 

## 3 Reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset
- I *don't* and *won't* ever know EVERYTHING there can be continual growth (**a good thing**)
- *Perfection is the enemy of to trying to grow*
- **take a break when you hit a road block... it's going to break later anyway**
