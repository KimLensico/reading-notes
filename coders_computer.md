#Choosing a Text Editor
- in the long-term it doesn't matter as to which text editor you use
  - each one has different features but overall work the same 
- A text editor is a piece of software that is downloaded/installed on your computer or accessed online through your web browser 
- Allows to write/manage text in order to build a website
 
 ##What features should you look for in a text editor?
 1. code completion
 2. syntax highlighting
 3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain/fatigue)
 4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
 
 ## Code Completion
- displays possible suggestions based on what you originally typed 
- saves time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
- includes the closing of tags when:
  - opened 
  - closing of brackets when opened
  - closing of quotation marks when you open them
  
### Emmet
- speeds up code writing fast 
- some text editors come with Emmet built right in
- Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.

## Syntax Highlighting
- colorizes text/code 
- attributes are a different color than elements 
- elements are a different color than copy
- helps read text/code better 

## Themes
- themes allow you to:
  - change the color of the background of your text editor
  - the series of colors in your text
  - sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software 
  - Usually, web developers use a dark background and brightly colored text. 
    - This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
- itâ€™s good to find a theme that might reduce eye strain/fatigue

## Extensions
- plugins for text editor
- adds functionality as you need it
