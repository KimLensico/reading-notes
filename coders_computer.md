# Choosing a Text Editor
- in the long-term it doesn't matter as to which text editor you use
  - each one has different features but overall work the same 
- A text editor is a piece of software that is downloaded/installed on your computer or accessed online through your web browser 
- Allows to write/manage text in order to build a website
 
 ## What features should you look for in a text editor?
 1. code completion
 2. syntax highlighting
 3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain/fatigue)
 4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
 
 ## Code Completion
- displays possible suggestions based on what you originally typed 
- saves time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
- includes the closing of tags when:
  - opened 
  - closing of brackets when opened
  - closing of quotation marks when you open them
  
### Emmet
- speeds up code writing fast 
- some text editors come with Emmet built right in
- Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.

## Syntax Highlighting
- colorizes text/code 
- attributes are a different color than elements 
- elements are a different color than copy
- helps read text/code better 

## Themes
- themes allow you to:
  - change the color of the background of your text editor
  - the series of colors in your text
  - sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software 
  - Usually, web developers use a dark background and brightly colored text. 
    - This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
- itâ€™s good to find a theme that might reduce eye strain/fatigue

## Extensions
- plugins for text editor
- adds functionality as you need it

_Overall it's important to see what allows you to be the most efficient at coding. Choosing one might change the outcome compared to another. While they all work similar enough, it's important to find the one (or multiple if you switch off) that shows you the results and functions you're looking for as a coder. _
