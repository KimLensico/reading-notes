# Programming
- script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal
- each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all instructions
- computers approach tasks differently than humans. instructions must let the computer sold the task programmatically
- to approach writing a script, break down goal into series of tasks and then work out each step needed (like a flowchart)

## Expressions
1. Assign a value to a variable

``` var color = 'beige';```

2. Use two or more values to return a single value

``` var area = 3 * 2```

## Operators
- expressions rely on operators
- allow programmers to create a single value fom one or ore values 

### Arithmetic Operators
- JS contains the following mathmatical operators, used with numbers
- must order specifically how you want things to go or else they might calculate or combine differently

**The only string operator is the + symbol. It joins the strings on either side**
- joining multiple strings to become a new string is called *concatenation*
- ex. numbers in quotations = string
- nan = not a number
