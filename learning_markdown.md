# What is Markdown?!

> *When you add bold, italics, numbered lists, bullet points, headings, and so on to text, you’re “formatting” it. Markdown is a syntax—or, set of rules—that formats text on web pages.* - @[howtogeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/448323/what-is-markdown-and-how-do-you-use-it/#:~:text=When%20you%20add%20bold%2C%20italics,Language%2C%20better%20known%20as%20HTML.)

The *simplest* way to explain is a rule and what happens to the text when you follow that rule! 
  
|   MARKDOWN CODES             | EXAMPLE            |
|------------------------------|--------------------|
|```# Heading 1```             |
|```## Heading 2```            |
|```###Heading 3```            |
|```###### heading 6``` (max)  |
|``` - item 1```               |
|```- item 2```                |
|```- item 3```                |
|```**bold text**```           |
