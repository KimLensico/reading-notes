### What is Markdown?!

> *When you add bold, italics, numbered lists, bullet points, headings, and so on to text, you’re “formatting” it. Markdown is a syntax—or, set of rules—that formats text on web pages.* - @[howtogeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/448323/what-is-markdown-and-how-do-you-use-it/#:~:text=When%20you%20add%20bold%2C%20italics,Language%2C%20better%20known%20as%20HTML.)

The *simplest* way to explain is a rule and what happens to the text when you follow that rule! It uses symbols like # or * to structure the page.

Here's a list of some basics:
  
|   MARKDOWN RULES             | EXAMPLE                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|```**bold text**```           | **bold text**                |
|```*italicize text*```        | *italicize text*             |
|```~~strike text~~```         | ~~strike text~~              |
|```[link](url)```             | [link](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2193644/discussion_topics/9431584)                  |

* In order for these codes to work, the file MUST be an .md or .markdown file.
