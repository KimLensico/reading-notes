## What is Markdown and How do I use it on Github?!

> *Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.* - @[github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Markdown is used to show content on a website without using too much coding- as it's known to be a lightweight markup language for html files. It's not an editor where you can press a button to change things. There has to be a format to what you want to do. 

The *simplest* way to explain is a rule and what happens to the text when you follow that rule! It uses symbols like # or * to structure the page.

Here's a list of some basics:
  
|   MARKDOWN RULES             | EXAMPLE                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
|```**bold text**```           | **bold text**                |
|```*italicize text*```        | *italicize text*             |
|```~~strike text~~```         | ~~strike text~~              |
|```[link](url)```             | [link](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2193644/discussion_topics/9431584)                  |

**In order for these codes to work, the file MUST be an .md or .markdown file on Github. Think of it as your 'setup' before you start using markup!** 

### Okay... But how to I use it on GitHub??

In GitHub you're able to make a "sandbox". This is basically an empty canvas for text so you can try everything out. All you have to do is click new on your homapage. That link takes you to create a repository to start your new webpage. You can find the link to attach your webage under Settings after creating the page. (keep scrolling, it's there somewhere) Once you find the link, copy it, go back to the home page of your repository, click the cog symbol to your left and paste it so you can officially make your web experiment ALIVE. 

***KEEP THE NAME lower CASE AND PUT DASHES IN-BETWEEN-WORDS OR ELSE IT MESSES THINGS UP IN THE LONG RUN.***
